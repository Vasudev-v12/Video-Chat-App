This is a simple Video Chat Project made with AgoraSDK



SETUP

* this project required one user to download this repository, and host the video chat server on their local machine.
* the other users need to connect to the host's ip address using https.
* Host must generate public and private key SSL certificates with tools like 'mkcert'.



FEATURES

* This app can support up to 5 users with some lag on a host machine with some (good wifi and intel i5 10th Gen Processor).
* It can be used through mobile as well.
* Has screen sharing option.



FUTURE UPDATES

* plan to add text chatting features, emotes, white board etc.
* plan to create a client app to connect to the host server.
* plan to create my own video streaming server.
